                <h1> Uses </h1>
                    <p>
                    Inspired by Wes Bos's <a href="https://uses.tech/">Uses</a> page, here is a list of all the tools and tech that I usually have in my EDC.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h2> Hardware & Devices</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h3> Laptop - Acer Swift Go 14 (SFG14-73) </h3>
                                <p>
                                The laptop is portable and powerful. It is capable of handling most of my programming and data analysis tasks with ease. The battery life is absolutely incredible, lasts for more than 6 hours on a single charge. The OLED display is a game-changer. One of the cheapest and best in the 14-inch category.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <ul class="Works-list">
                                    <li> <strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Ultra 7 155H 16-cores/22-threads @ 4.80 GHz</li>
                                    <li> <strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB Micron MT62F1G32D2DS-026 6400 MT/s LDDR5</li>
                                    <li> <strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB WD SN740 PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD</li>
                                    <li> <strong>GPU:</strong> Intel Arc Graphics @ 2.25 GHz</li>

                                <br>
                        <h3> Phone - Redmi Note 10 Pro (M2101K6P)</h3>
                        <p>
                            This phone has been my daily driver for the past 4 years and it has been going strong. I don't really like the MIUI android skin, so I have installed PixelOS. The stock android expereince on this hardware is really smooth and fast. The only drawback is the lack of 5G support.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul class="Works-list">
                            <li> <strong>CPU:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G @ 2.3 GHz</li>
                            <li> <strong>RAM / Storage:</strong> 8GB / 128GB UFS 2.2 </li>
                            <li> <strong>GPU:</strong> Adreno 618 @ 750 MHz</li>
                            <li> <strong>Display:</strong> 1080p AMOLED @ 120 Hz</li>
                            <li> <strong>OS:</strong> <a href="https://pixelos.net/download/sweet">PixelOS - Android 15</a></li>
                            <li> <strong> Network:</strong> GSM/HSPA/LTE</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Headphones - JBL-770NC </h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the cheapest headphones to provide active noise cancellation. The ANC is not mind-altering but gets the job done. The sound quality is great after playing around with the EQ. The battery life is impressive, I usually charge it once a week. The built quality is decent. The earcups are okay, but not really comfortable for someone who wears glasses.
                        </p>

                        <h2> Terminal & Shell </h2>
                        <h3> Emulator - Kitty</h3>
                        <p>
                        <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> is an open-source terminal emulator, that supports GPU rendering. It is fast, lightweight and I love how it allows me to customise the look and feel of the terminal and with zsh, it works like a charm. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Shell - zsh (OhMyZsh)</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">zsh (OhMyZsh)</a> as my default shell. Currently using a customised version of frontcube theme, using Catppuccin color scheme. I have two plugins installed: <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions">zsh-autosuggestions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting">zsh-syntax-highlighting</a>.
                        </p>    
                        <br>
                        <h3> Font - JetBrains Mono</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a> as my default font. Mostly used by developers, so I jumped on the bandwagon and has been using it for a while now. .  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2> Software </h2>
                        <h3> Operating System - Fedora 42</h3>
                        <p>
                        I have experimented with my fare share of Linux distros, from Arch to Mint, but between bleeding-edge and stability, I chose Fedora as it is stable as well as has a great update cycle. Also don't mind me as I am a sucker for GNOME.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Code Editor - Emacs & VSCode</h3>
                        <p>
                        I have used <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> as my primary code editors. I use Emacs whenever I want to go full analog mode with no extensions, while VSCode is for days when I want to use Co-Pilot and extensions to ease out my workflow.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Version Control System - GitHub</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for all my open-source projects. The LFS support is useful for larger projects. It has now become a habit to push my code on GitHub and keep all my projects in one platform. GitHub pages has made it possible to host this website as well.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Containerisation - Docker</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for containerisation of my projects that require a specific environment. This reduces the hassle of setting up the environment and makes collaboration easier.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2> Productivity </h2>
                        <h3> Browser - Zen </h3>
                        <p>
                            I switched from Firefox to <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen browser</a> as it is best of both world's - an interface like Safari and Firefox's engine - Gecko. Zen's sidebar-design is very handy. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Notes - Obsidian</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> has been my primary note taking app as it has a lot of community plugins. Absolutely love the inline LaTeX support.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Cloud Ecosystem - Google</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use Google services for my cloud ecosystem. Since I use an android phone, it is easier to use Google services to sync all my devices.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> Design - Photoshop</h3>
                        <p>
                            Whenever my creative mind says, <i>"Let's make a ridiculous t-shirt that is socially unacceptable"</i>, I use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> to make it. I have been using Photoshop since I was 3 years old and it has stuck with me ever since.
                        </p>
